"""Look up IETF RFCs from the command line.

Standard library only, deliberately: this file is vendored verbatim into a
ClawHub skill and into a PyPI package, and both need to run wherever there is a
Python interpreter and nothing else.

Two runtime modes, decided by one predicate — whether a local mirror is
populated. Online mode fetches documents on demand over HTTPS; offline mode
reads them from disk and can search their full text. There is no build-time
flavour and no separate "offline edition"; `rfc sync` moves you from one mode to
the other and everything else behaves the same.

The index-parsing approach here — match entries by a leading RFC number, treat
"Not Issued" as a placeholder — follows mcp-server-ietf (MIT, Copyright (c) 2025
Jeff Chiang), https://github.com/tizee/mcp-server-ietf. See NOTICE. The parser
itself is a rewrite; the original's regexes are documented as counter-examples
in parse_index() below.

             Mogul, H. Frystyk, L. Masinter, P. Leach, T. Berners-Lee. June 1999.
             (Format: TXT, PS, PDF, HTML) (Obsoletes RFC2068) (Obsoleted by
             RFC7230, RFC7231, RFC7232, RFC7233, RFC7234, RFC7235) (Updated by

    Three traps, each of which has bitten a previous implementation:

    1. Entries begin at column 0; continuation lines are indented and entries are
       separated by blank lines. Reading line by line therefore sees only the
       first physical line of an entry and loses most of the metadata. Join the
       record before parsing anything.

    2. RFC numbers are *not* zero-padded. A regex expecting four or five digits
       silently drops all 999 RFCs below 1000 — including 768, 791, 793 and 959.

    3. The title cannot be taken as everything before the first period. That
       yields "Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1" above, and corrupts every
       title containing a version number, an abbreviation or a hostname. The
       title ends where the author list begins; find that boundary explicitly.

    The index is refreshed if it is missing or older than the TTL. The second
    half of the return is for load_index: a revalidation the CDN answers 304 to
    still moves the mtime, and re-parsing 2 MB of text that did not change is
    pure work — every day, for a server that stays up.

    The index must not be a write-once cache. An index fetched in January will
    report an RFC published in March as nonexistent, even though its URL fetches
    perfectly well, and there is no way for the user to tell why.

    Revalidation sends both If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since. Since
    2026-08-03 the RFC Editor's CDN honours the first: handed back its own ETag
    it answers 304, so refreshing an index that has not changed costs a header
    exchange rather than 2 MB. It still sends no Last-Modified, and
    ietf-tools/red#475 was closed on 2026-08-03 with that half explicitly
    skipped, so do not expect If-Modified-Since to produce a 304 on its own. It
    is sent anyway because RFC 9110 gives If-None-Match precedence wherever both
    are present, which makes it free, and it would cover an index whose stored
    ETag was lost if the CDN ever starts emitting one.

    A refresh that cannot reach the network is not a failure when an index is
    already on disk. A day-old copy answers nearly every question a current one
    does, and refusing to search because a revalidation timed out is far worse
    than answering from it. The mtime is deliberately left alone in that case,
